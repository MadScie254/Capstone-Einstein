    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Technical Losses (NTL) represent electricity consumed but not billed, primarily due to:\n",
    "- **Meter tampering and bypass** (physical intervention)\n",
    "- **Billing manipulation** (administrative fraud)\n",
    "- **Illegal connections** (unauthorized grid access)\n",
    "- **Data corruption** (transmission errors, meter malfunction)\n",
    "\n",
    "Global utilities lose an estimated **USD 96 billion annually** to NTL (World Bank, 2019). In developing markets, NTL can exceed 20% of total energy distributed, directly impacting:\n",
    "- Revenue assurance and financial stability\n",
    "- Cross-subsidy distortions (honest customers pay more)\n",
    "- Grid planning accuracy (demand forecasting errors)\n",
    "- Regulatory compliance and public trust\n",

    "1. **Customer segmentation** to establish behavioral baselines\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised anomaly detection** for pattern-based screening\n",
    "3. **Supervised classification** where labeled data exists\n",
    "4. **Explainable scoring** for inspector prioritization\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 What Constitutes \"Theft\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For modeling purposes, we define electricity theft as **consumption patterns inconsistent with meter-registered usage that cannot be explained by legitimate behavioral changes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key distinction: **Abnormal is not equivalent to fraudulent.**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Classification | Model Implication |\n",
    "|----------|----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| Sudden 80% consumption drop, no meter issues | Suspicious | Flag for investigation |\n",
    "| Seasonal vacation pattern (regular annual) | Normal | Learn seasonal baselines |\n",
    "| New industrial equipment installation | Normal | Detect legitimate step change |\n",
    "| Meter replaced, data gap followed by change | Ambiguous | Exclude from training |\n",
    "| Consistent zero readings, building occupied | Suspicious | High-priority flag |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Why Naive Thresholding Fails\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach is: \"Flag customers whose consumption dropped >50% month-over-month.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:**\n",
    "1. **Seasonal variation:** Air conditioning load in summer vs. winter creates legitimate 50%+ swings\n",
    "2. **Customer heterogeneity:** A 50% drop for a commercial flat-load customer is meaningful; for a vacation home, it is expected\n",
    "3. **Adversarial adaptation:** Sophisticated actors reduce consumption gradually to avoid threshold triggers\n",
    "4. **Data quality:** Meter resets, transmission gaps, and billing cycle shifts create false signals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Operational Cost of Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "| Error Type | Operational Impact | Estimated Cost |\n",
    "|------------|-------------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **False Positive** | Wasted inspection, customer dispute, reputational damage | USD 150-500 per case |\n",
    "| **False Negative** | Continued revenue loss, unfair burden on honest customers | USD 200-2000/month/customer |\n",
    "\n",
    "The asymmetry varies by jurisdiction. In markets with strong consumer protection, false positives are particularly costly. This system emphasizes **precision at the top of the ranked list** (precision@k) over raw accuracy."

    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Smart Meter Data Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) provides:\n",
    "- **Temporal resolution:** 15-minute to hourly intervals\n",
    "- **Coverage:** 90-98% of residential and commercial customers in deployed regions\n",
    "- **Data dimensions:** Active/reactive power, voltage, power factor, tamper events\n",

    "### 3.2 Data Quality Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "| Issue | Prevalence | Mitigation |\n",
    "|-------|------------|------------|\n",
    "| Missing readings | 5-15% of records | Seasonal median imputation with quality flags |\n",
    "| Communication gaps | 2-8% of meters at any time | Gap duration tracking; exclude long gaps from training |\n",
    "| Meter replacements | 3-5% annually | Detect discontinuities; reset baseline |\n",
    "| Time zone / DST errors | Occasional | Validate temporal alignment |\n",
    "| Negative readings | Rare (<0.1%) | Physical validation; clamp or exclude |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Label Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "If historical labels exist (confirmed theft cases), they typically suffer from:\n",
    "- **Selection bias:** Only inspected customers are labeled\n",
    "- **Confirmation bias:** Inspectors find what they expect to find\n",
    "- **Temporal mismatch:** Theft may have occurred months before detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates our hybrid approach: use supervised learning where labels are reliable, but maintain unsupervised detection capability for discovery."

    "| **Rule-based** | Transparent, auditable | Rigid; easily circumvented |\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ensemble combines these methods, weighted by confidence and validated against historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Why Customer Clustering First\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers exhibit fundamentally different consumption patterns:\n",
    "- **Residential base-load:** Consistent 10-20 kWh/day with morning/evening peaks\n",
    "- **Residential high-variance:** 5-50 kWh/day with seasonal HVAC swings\n",
    "- **Commercial flat-load:** 100-500 kWh/day, 6-day pattern\n",
    "- **Industrial continuous:** 500+ kWh/day, minimal variance\n",
    "\n",
    "A single anomaly threshold applied globally would:\n",
    "- Under-flag low-variance commercial customers (subtle theft masked by scale)\n",
    "- Over-flag high-variance residential customers (legitimate volatility misclassified)\n",
    "\n",
    "We first segment customers into behavioral clusters, then train cluster-specific models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Why Explainability is Non-Negotiable\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory and operational requirements demand:\n",
    "1. **Audit trail:** Every flag must be traceable to specific data and model version\n",
    "2. **Inspector guidance:** Field teams need actionable reasons, not just scores\n",
    "3. **Dispute defense:** Customer challenges require evidence beyond \"the model said so\"\n",
    "4. **Bias detection:** Unexplainable patterns may indicate protected-class discrimination\n",
